<p><ul><li>Macular Edema</li><li>Macular Degeneration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Macular edema and macular degeneration are two distinct eye conditions that affect the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision. Macular edema involves swelling due to fluid accumulation, often linked to diabetes or retinal vein occlusion, affecting visual clarity. In contrast, macular degeneration, particularly age-related, results in the deterioration of retinal cells, leading to progressive vision loss. Both conditions present significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment, influencing the market for therapeutic interventions and innovation in ophthalmic care.</p></p>
