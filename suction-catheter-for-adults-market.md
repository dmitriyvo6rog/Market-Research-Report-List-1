<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suction Catheter for Adults Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Suction Catheter</li><li>Closed Suction Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suction catheter market for adults comprises two primary types: open suction catheters and closed suction catheters. Open suction catheters involve the use of a traditional suction technique where the catheter is exposed to the environment, facilitating airway clearance but increasing the risk of contamination. In contrast, closed suction catheters are encased in a sterile, protective sheath, allowing for safer, continuous suctioning without the need for disconnection from mechanical ventilation, minimizing the risk of infection and promoting patient comfort.</p></p>
