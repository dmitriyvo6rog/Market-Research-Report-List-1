<p><p>R123 refrigerant, also known as HCFC-123, is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) commonly used in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning and industrial cooling applications. It is known for its low ozone depletion potential (ODP) compared to older refrigerants like CFCs, making it a transitional option in the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. However, due to its global warming potential (GWP), R123 is being gradually replaced by more environmentally friendly alternatives like HFCs and HFOs.</p><p>The R123 refrigerant market is experiencing steady growth, driven by its continued use in existing HVAC systems and industrial cooling applications. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9% during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to the demand for retrofitting older systems and the need for efficient cooling solutions in developing regions. However, stringent environmental regulations and the shift toward low-GWP refrigerants are influencing market dynamics.</p><p>Recent trends in the R123 refrigerant market include increased focus on sustainable alternatives, advancements in refrigerant recycling and reclamation technologies, and growing adoption of energy-efficient cooling systems. Manufacturers are also investing in research and development to create eco-friendly refrigerants, which is reshaping the competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, R123 remains relevant in specific applications, particularly where retrofitting is more cost-effective than system replacement.</p></p>
