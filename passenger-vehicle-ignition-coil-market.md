<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Ignition Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-spark</li><li>Multi-spark</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle ignition coil market includes two main types: single-spark and multi-spark systems. Single-spark coils deliver one spark per ignition cycle, typically used in traditional engines with one coil per cylinder. Multi-spark coils generate multiple sparks in rapid succession during a single ignition cycle, improving combustion efficiency and reducing emissions. Multi-spark systems are increasingly adopted in modern vehicles for better performance and fuel economy, while single-spark systems remain prevalent in older or simpler engine designs. Both types are integral to engine ignition systems.</p></p>
