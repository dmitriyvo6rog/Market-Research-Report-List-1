<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insect Growth Regulator Bait Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chitin Synthesis Inhibitors</li><li>Juvenile Hormone Analogs & Mimics</li><li>Anti-Juvenile Hormone Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) bait market encompasses various types designed to disrupt insect development. Chitin synthesis inhibitors impede the production of chitin, essential for insect exoskeleton formation, leading to vulnerability and death. Juvenile hormone analogs and mimics interfere with maturation processes, preventing larvae from developing into adults. Anti-juvenile hormone agents destabilize established hormone patterns, causing pests to develop abnormally and die before reaching maturity. Together, these IGRs provide effective pest control by targeting developmental stages.</p></p>
