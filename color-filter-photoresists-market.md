<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Filter Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Color Filter Photoresists market is primarily divided into two types: negative photoresists and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists polymerize upon exposure to light, leading to hardening of the exposed areas, while the unexposed regions remain soluble and are washed away. In contrast, positive photoresists become soluble when exposed, allowing the desired pattern to be developed by removing the exposed areas. Each type plays a crucial role in the production of color filters for displays, impacting factors like resolution and application compatibility.</p></p>
