<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biosolids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Industrial Wastewater</li><li>Municipal Wastewater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biosolids market, derived from wastewater treatment, is segmented into industrial and municipal wastewater. Industrial wastewater biosolids originate from manufacturing, chemical, and processing plants, containing higher concentrations of heavy metals and chemicals, requiring specialized treatment. Municipal wastewater biosolids come from household sewage, with lower contaminant levels, often used in agriculture as fertilizer. Both markets focus on sustainable management, recycling nutrients, and reducing environmental impact, but differ in treatment complexity and end-use applications due to varying contaminant profiles and regulatory requirements.</p></p>
